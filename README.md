# Front-End Nanodegree Neighborhood Map (React)

## Project Overview

1. Neighborhood Map project is a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood with local cafes. It incorporates a variety of data points.

2. The goal of the project:
* develope a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood,
* add functionality to the map including highlighted locations, third-party data about locations and various ways to browse the content,
* learn how design patterns and UI libraries like React assist in developing a manageable codebase,
* explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use,
* implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.

### This is a final project created for [**Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program**](https://eu.udacity.com/).

## Information about Application Functionality

1. The application displays cafes in Wroclaw, Poland
2. **Location Filter** - filters the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input or selection. Use search bar to filter the list of cafe names.
3. **List View** - list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default and the filtered subset of locations when a filter is applied. Click on the chosen cafe to see the location on the map.
4. **Map and Markers** - map displays all location markers by default and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied. Click a marker to display information about a location in an info window.
